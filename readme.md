# Barista ESP32

Barista is a personal project to automatize my espresso machine (Breville The Infuser). It controls the machine via relays and can start/stop extractions with the help of a weight scale. Also, all results and commands are received or transmited via BLE.

## Current Features

- Automatic extraction start with preinfusion time setup
- Automatic extraction stop when a target weight is reached
- Real Time Weight report to client via BLE


## Planned Features

- Use ESP32's WiFi to setup a wake up time and turn on the machine at the appropiate time
- Replace relays for BJT transistors
